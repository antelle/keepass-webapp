# Building

The app can be built with grunt: `grunt` (html file will be in `dist/`).    
Desktop apps are built with `grunt desktop`. This works only in mac osx as it builds dmg; requires wine.  
To run Electron app without building installer, install electron package (`npm install electron -g`), build the app with `grunt` and start in this way:
```bash
$ grunt dev
$ npm run-script electron
```

For debug build:

1. run `grunt dev`
2. open `http://localhost:8085/tmp`
